# 🧠 AR/VR Practical Assignments – LP II (B.E. Computer Engineering)

This repository contains **15 practical assignments** developed as part of the **Augmented and Virtual Reality Lab (LP II)** for the third year of the B.E. Computer Engineering program. Each scene demonstrates a key concept or interaction in Unity using AR/VR frameworks.
